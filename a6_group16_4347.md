# A

html page with select query and form, example shown has SQLi:

the original routine query:
```sql
SELECT ArtistName FROM artists WHERE ArtistName = '$name'
```

![[Pasted image 20231120172814.png]]

the injection query:

```sql
SELECT ArtistName FROM artists WHERE ArtistName = ''OR '1' = 1'
```

which results in:

![[Pasted image 20231120172838.png]]

# B

form with update command, example shows sqli which affects the entire table:

the original routine query:

```sql
UPDATE artists SET ArtistName = '$newName' where ArtistName = '$name'
```

![[Pasted image 20231120172949.png]]

the injected query:

```sql
UPDATE artists SET ArtistName = 'Hacker 2' where ArtistName = ''OR '1' = 1'
```

which results in:

![[Pasted image 20231120173013.png]]

# C

the fix is to have a prepared statement.

prepared statement of part A:

```php
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM artists WHERE ArtistName = ?");

$stmt->bind_param("s", $name);

$stmt->execute();

$result = $stmt->get_result();
```

so:

![[Pasted image 20231120174018.png]]

results in:

```php
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM artists WHERE ArtistName = ?");

$stmt->bind_param("s", $name); //$name = ' OR '1' = 1

$stmt->execute();

//$stmt is now "' OR '1' = 1", which is a string, not valid SQL

$result = $stmt->get_result();
```
